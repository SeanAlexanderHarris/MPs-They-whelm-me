# Parliament 2018 - Is it possible to be just "whelmed"?

This kata set was designed to help students preparing for the Core Block Review to practise working with:

* Arrays and objects
* Reduce
* hofs incl. map, filter, forEach

Tests have been drafted though they are by no means exhaustive. Feel free to add and tweak as you see fit.

To state the rather obvious, functions have been named for my amusement rather and to conform to more sensible naming conventions. Sorrynotsorry. I recommend using better naming conventions in your code as you work through them.

Irony points are available for humour (in good taste please) and are redeemable for political capital and jars of Corbo's allotment jam in fields of wheat in the Maidenhead constituency.

## 12. #expensesClaim

Write a function that takes a cost parameter as a memberID, cost, a quantity as a number, and an item as a string (e.g. 'duck house'). The function should return an expense claim object with the following keys: item, amount, cost per item, total cost. For a bonus irony point, include a thank you message key which has a message thanking the MP for their hard work and invaluable service. 

### Examples:

```js
expensesClaim(41386, 700, 3, 'bottle of Bollanger 68'); // returns {
  MP: "Stephen Metcalfe", 
  constituency: "South Basildon and East Thurrock", 
  item : 'bottle of Bollanger 68,
  amount : 3,
  costPerItem : 700,

totalYearsOfService(madeUpData); // returns '3070 years... that's 4.72 years per MP.'

```

## 14. #debate

Write a function that takes the person IDs of two MPs and pits them against each other in a debate. The MP who has the longer constinency name will use their cunning and guile to outwit their opponent at the dispatch box.

### Examples:

```js
debate(25358, 25169); // returns 'Andy McDonald beats Sue Hayman in a heated debate in the chamber. Yaaas queen!'
```
